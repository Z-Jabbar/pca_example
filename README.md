# PCA Feature Extraction (MATLAB)

This repository contains a MATLAB snippet demonstrating **PCA feature extraction** and **Euclidean distance calculation** for a test image.  

## Notes
- This code is **only a part of a full PCA / Eigenfaces project**.  
- To run it fully, you would need:
  - Precomputed Eigenfaces
  - Centered training images (`ProjectedImages`)
  - The mean image (`m`)
  - Number of training images (`Train_Number`)  

- No real images are included for privacy reasons. This snippet is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
